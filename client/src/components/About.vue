      We recently launched this website out of frustration in finding good restaurants serving authentic spicy meals. The kind that will blow your mind away and strike fire in your mouth!
    </p>
    <p>
      As a spicy food affectionato, isnâ€™t it frustrating when you ask for a spicy meal, even insist on getting the highest spiciest level, and the waiter just nods and brings you a mildly spicy dish at best?
    </p>
    <p>
      This site brings us together, the spicy and hot food lovers, where we can share and rate the best restaurants. We deserve to get what we love the best: burning hot food!
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to add new cities, towns, restaurants, reviews as we expand our network of authentic spicy cuisine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to make it easier and faster to locate restaurants that will actually serve satisfying hot and spicy dishes, true to our taste buds!
